Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

Procedure Flowater:

1) Split the dataset into Train and Test dataset, by extracting 10th year data for parameter 9-13 for every section. 

2) Applied Extra Regressor Model to implent random forest and predicted the corresponding values.
